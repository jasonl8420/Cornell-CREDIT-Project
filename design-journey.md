## Client Description (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about your client. Who is your client?
> Explain why your client meets the client rules in the project requirements.

Our client is the club Credit, a real estate development trust on Cornell's campus. The club trains undergraduate Cornell students to help them understand real estate and also performs case studies for clients in the industry. Our client meets the rules in the project requirements because nobody in our group is a member of Credit, and no team member has a close personal relationship with the client. Furthermore, the client is able to meet with us throughout the design journey.

## Client Website (Milestone 1)
> Tell us about the website that your client wants. Tell us the purpose of the website and what it is all about.
> NOTE: **If you are redesigning an existing website, give us the current URL and some screenshots of the current site.** (FireFox makes it easy to take a full screenshot of a page.) Tell us how you plan to update the site in a significant way that meets the project's requirements.

The client would like a website pertaining to the CREDIT club of Cornell. They are looking for a medium size website, around 5-6 pages. Their over arching goals are to reach potential applicants to the site and give them information about the club's job of helping undergraduates understand real estate, giving more in depth and real world education to Cornell students interested in the field. They want to give viewers of the website all they need to know before they apply. They also want to give insight into the members of the club, giving an overview on each member. This is helpful for viewers such as scouts and potential recruiters.

## Client Website Scope (Milestone 1)
> Your project should be ambitious, but not too large. A good rule-of-thumb is that you should have about 1 content-full page for each team member.
> Explain why the website you will create for your client isn't too small and isn't too big. Explain why you think it's the right size for this project.

After meeting with our client, the CREDIT club of Cornell, we were better informed of their scope and goal as a club. Just to summarize briefly, our client is not only looking to be a helping hand in assisting undergraduates become familiar with real estate, but also prepare students for real world applications of their earned knowledge. Thus, with the scope of club's goals, the website should also work to complement/encompass it. Also, since the CREDIT club is still a student-run organization the website shouldn't be excessively big nor small. Given that the intended size of the website is approximately a 4 - 5 page worth of content, which is about 1 content-full page for each team member and adequately includes all our client's desired goals, the website is the right size for this project.

## Client Goals (Milestone 1)
> What kind of website do they want? What are their goals for the site?
> There is no required number of goals. You need as many goals as necessary to reflect your client's desires.

- Goal A: A 4 - 5 page website
- Goal B: A leadership page, about page, and recruitment page on the website
- Goal C: They want the website to contain a list of their values
- Goal D: A leadership page, about page, and recruitment page on the website
- Goal E: They want their site to make a good impression on recruiters and applicants.
- Goal F: They want to provide applicants with information about their club
- Goal G: They want the site to be clean and professional

# Site Design/Plan (Milestone 2)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality but doesn't have to be fancy.

## Understanding Users (Milestone 2)

### Audience (Milestone 2)
> Briefly explain your site's audience. Be specific and justify why this audience is a cohesive group with regard to your client's site. This audience should not be overly broad nor arbitrarily specific. It should be a cohesive group with similar _goals_.

The audience of the site is Cornell students interested in real estate development and investment.

Justification: This audience is a cohesive group with regards to the site because they all share a common interest in the focus of the club: real estate development and investment. A goal of the site is to recruit new members and a goal of the audience is to find involvement relating to their interest in real estate development and investment. Thus the audience is likely to apply to the club, accomplishing both their goals and the clubs goals for the site.


### User Interview Questions (Milestone 2)
> Plan the user interview which you'll use to identify the goals of your site's audience.

**User Interview Briefing & Consent:** Hi, I am a student at Cornell University. I'm currently taking a class on web design and for a project I am (re-)designing a web site for _client's name_. I'm trying to learn more about the people that might use this site. May I ask you a few questions? It will take about 10-15 minutes. You are free to quit at any time.

### Goals (Milestone 2)
> Analyze your audience's goals from your notes above. List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need enough to do the job (Hint: It's more than 1 and probably more than 2).

Goal 1: Know leaders of club and how to reach out to current members
- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - We will have a members page that gives profiles for leaders and contact information for every member.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - Our audience expressed that large help for them in application processes was the ability to contact members of the club, especially the leaders.

Goal 2: Easily access all application information

  - We will provide users with a page that contains a timeline of the application process as well as information session info and all other application requirements/tips.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - Users found it difficult to navigate the application process and it will be helpful for users to access this information in a centralized location.

Goal 3: Learn more about the club
- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - We will provide information that shows the club's goals, mission statement, current projects, and new opportunities for members.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._

## Content Planning (Milestone 2)

**Plan your site's content.**

### Your Site's Planned Content (Milestone 2)
> List the content you plan to include your personal website. This should be a comprehensive list.

- About CREDIT paragraph
- Hero image
- mission statement
- Partners and sponsors
- images of Cornell
- Club opportunities and current projects
- List of members
- Images of members
- Leadership member contact information
- Application timeline
- information session and prospective member application resources
- Past project example
- common terms sheet resource
- ~~Members Only Link~~
- application requirements

**At first, the client requested that we include content for their own members to access. After Milestone 2, we decided to remove the "Members Only Link," however, this does not change any of the other content or content groupings. Furthermore, much of the content that the client promised to provide us was not provided.**

### Content Justification (Milestone 2)
> Explain (about a paragraph) why this content is the right content for your site's audience and how its addressed their goals..

This content highlights the four audience goals that we found from our research interviews. Users want to know the leaders of the club and if/how they are able to contact them. On the application page, the content will urge applicants to contact leaders through the current members and leaders page that will outline contact information for leaders.The audience also wants easy access to application information and timelines, which will be clear on the page for new applications containing application timeline, tips to apply, application resources, and information session information. The audience will learn briefly about the club on the home page with club opportunities, club goals, partners and sponsors, and mission statement. Lastly, users can learn more about real estate and the most important information by accessing the Resources page, which will contain common terms and a background of real estate.

## Information Architecture (Milestone 2)

### Content Organization (Milestone 2)
> Document your iterations of card sorting here.
> Include photographic evidence of each iteration of card sorting and description of your thought process for each iteration.

Iteration 1
![first iteration](iteration1.jpeg)
In this iteration of card sorting, we brainstormed the idea of introducing members of the club first along with the mission statement in order for the audience to get a sense of the people that make up the organization. In addition, one of the interview responses recall not knowing who to contact, thus providing this information foremost could be helpful. Consequently, all the other information has been grouped together in relevance. For example, the second grouping provides context of the site while the third grouping is solely dedicated to bring forth general information regarding the application process. Lastly, the last grouping provides excess information regarding the application process and the organization if the audience is looking for more information at the end.

Iteration 2
![second iteration](iteration2.jpeg)

This iteration deviates from the first iteration in that the content of the first and the second page of the website is oriented towards providing context/information of the club. Then, the third grouping provides information of current members and their contact info so that the users can reach out to them  if interested. Lastly, differing from the previous iteration, all the resources have been compiled into one grouping in an effort to simplify the navigatio. This would allow the users to find most, if not all of their questions regarding the application process as well as the club itself in one page.

Iteration 3
![third iteration](iteration3.jpeg)
Lastly, this iteration of card sorting can be seen as a combination of the previous iterations. We attempted to take the positives of each iterations and implement them effectively. The first grouping serves as an introduction to the club/organization. Thus, contents ranging from mission statement to club opportunities seemed appropriate. Then, we felt it was apt to introduce the members of the club to allow the users to gain information on the group of people that make up the club and who to reach out. Then, based on the information provided regarding the club and the team, if the user is interested in applying, he or she can take a look at page dedicated to the application process. There, the users can learn about not only the overall timeline of the application process but also other information such as application tips that will help guide them through the process. Lastly, if they are in search of additional information, the last grouping can help the users learn further about the club as well as the application process.

### Final Content Organization (Milestone 2)
> Which iteration of card sorting will you use for your website?

Third iteration of card sorting.

> Explain how the final organization of content is appropriate for your site's audiences and their goals.

 This layout is intuitive for users by grouping each page by the user goal. On the main page, recruiters and prospective members can see what the club's mission is and the current projects they are working on. Users can expect to find member/contact information on one page, which will be useful for prospective members to be able to contact current members, and for recruiters to see who is in a leadership position in the club. Then, there will be a page that is specific to new members so that they can easily access information about the application timeline and tips for the process (attire and other general information). Then, the page with resources will address the need for users to access information about real estate that new members may not already know, which will help prospective members through the process.


### Navigation (Milestone 2)
> Please list the pages you will include in your personal website navigation.

- Home
- How to Apply
- Meet the Team
- Resources

> Explain why the names of these pages make sense for your site's audience and their goals.

Home is self explanatory and familiar. It gives broad information from the club and is a good introduction for both members and applications. The "How to Apply" page gives those wanting to apply a direct line to the information they need that will easily catch their eye. "Meet our team" shows all members of the club as well as extensive information on leaders and how to contact them. we chose the meet our team because it emphasizes meeting them e.g. contacting them through the information on the page. The resources page is helpful to applicants and provides helpful resources for both goals of applying as well as participating and learning in the club.

## Design (Milestone 2)

### Visual Theme (Milestone 2)
> Discuss several (more than two) ideas about styling your site's theme. Explain why the theme ideas are appropriate for your target audiences.
> Note the theme you selected for you site and why it's appropriate for the audience and their goals.

The site's theme will be professional and minimalistic. It will feature and red, white, and black color palette. These themes are appropriate for our target audience. Our target audience is made up of Cornell Students interested in real estate investment and development, current students, and recruiters. It is particularly important for the site to convey professionalism to appeal to both recruiters and current students. A minimalistic design will also help recruiters, current members, and interested students to efficiently navigate the site. The red, black, and white color palette contains the Cornell colors. This is fitting because the site is for a Cornell club.


### Interactivity Ideas (Milestone 2)
> Brainstorm several ideas for your site's interactivity.
> Provide a very brief summary how each idea improves the usability of the site for the site's audience.

- sticky navigation bar for Desktop: this would allow users to easily access other parts of the site no matter what part of the page they are on
- carousel of current projects on home page: users would immediately be able to see what Credit is currently working on and it would not take up too much room
- pop-outs on members page: this would allow users to see the contact information of specific members without cluttering the page with too much contact information
- hamburger navigation bar on Mobile: this would allow users to get to other parts of the site without having to scroll all the way to the top and it would reduce the share of the screen that navigation takes up

### Layout Exploration (Milestone 2)
 > Sketch both the mobile and desktop versions of the site.
> Here you are just exploring your layout ideas. You don't need to sketch every page.
> Provide an explanation for each sketch explaining the idea and the design patterns you are leveraging.

![Home Page Iteration 1 Desktop](roughome11.JPG)
This first layout exploration was based on what we felt as intuitive. Upon first entering the website, first being introduced to the club's mission statement as well as "About" page would be not only be welcoming for the users, but also gives the users general idea of what the club is like. In addition, hero image is included as a background image that will amplify the overall atmosphere of the website. Overall, the layout itself is structured and simple, so that the users can focus on the content while the page is still professional and minimal.

![Home Page Iteration 1 Mobile](roughhome1.JPG)
The mobile version of this iteration essentially reorganizes the content vertically. Similarly, the layout is simple, taking the users through the content with minimal confusion.  

![Resources First Sketch](resources-sketch1.png)
This design gives the most relevant information immediately in an intuitive way. The simply layout lets people read from top to bottom and view one section at a time.
![Resources Second Sketch](resources-iter1.png)
This layout fills the page in a way that makes better use of the space. Users can see the project on the left, and since that will consume more space, it has the entire left side of the screen. On the right, the users can view the common terms and the link to the members only page, and since those take up less space, they share the second half of the screen.

![team iteration 1](team-iteration1.png)
This iteration focuses on image left, verbal content right. Since the focus content of this page is memebers, I began to think of structuring it similar to how you look up people on facebook or linkden. However, since there are so many memebers, this takes a lot of scrolling. This can be harmful to the user's goal since there is no alphabetical order and it could take them time to find the memeber they want.

![team iteration 2](team-iteration2.png)
This iteraction has a more clear and simple view. It is minimalist and looks more professional, which both helps the audience and achieves the goal of the client.  

![Home Page Iteration 2 Desktop](roughome2.JPG)
This iteration of layout differs largely from the first one in that rather than having a background image, which we thought might end up distracting the users from the content, adding the hero image with mission statement instead could provide exciting introduction to the users. The pattern also aids the users natural reading pattern as well.

![Home Page Iteration 2 Mobile](roughhome22.JPG)
Again, the mobile version of this iteration vertically lays out the desktop version so that the content can stay coherent regardless of which versio the users might utilize. The users first enter to the brief introduction of the club, providing context, and rest of the content follows sequentially.

### Final Interactivity Design (Milestone 2)
> Explain and/or provide annotated sketches of the interactivity you will implement for your site.
> Explain how the interactivity improves the usability of the site and helps the site's audiences meet their goals.

![Modal Box Interactivity](team-interactivity.png)
For this portion of interactivity, we will be using modal boxes in order to expand information on certain leaders in the club. When the image of the leader is clicked on, a modal box will pop up with constant information as well as a brief description of their academic life. This will help to not crowd the page, as well as give clear information to the user. The audience goal's include finding resources to contact members of the club in order to gain more information about the club. This interactivity design allows this to happen, while preventing a crowded screen.

![Carousel Interactivity](carouselsketch.JPG)
The interactivity significantly improves the usability of the site because it maximizes space. Meaning, not only does the page look much more coherent and simple, but it also allows the users to scroll less trying to navigate through all the images. In addition, it can contain large number of images, which makes the experience much more enjoyable than reading body of texts. Lastly, the interactivity helps the site's audience meet their goals because it is effective in providing greater context about the club. As one of the goals of the site's audience is to learn more about the club, the carousel interactivity can help the audience learn more about what the club consists of in addition to the body of great people that make up the club. The arrows and dots that are signature to a carousel are familiar, and therefore easy to use for the audience, as well as increases accessibility and affordances. The audience will immediately understand how to interact with this feature and will use it to further understand the club's atmosphere and goals, without causing too much clutter on the page.

![Embed Interactivity/Responsiveness](resize.png)
When the window is resized, the width of the powerpoint presentation will change in order to be more readable for users. The embed element has its width and height elements set in HTML, not CSS, so the only way to make this element responsive is to use JavaScript. This meets the audience's goal of being able to access information about real estate, and ensures that the powerpoint is accessible and usable.

### Final Design (Milestone 2)
> Include the final sketches for **each** of your site's pages.
> The sketches must include enough detail that another 1300 student could implement them.
> Provide a explanation for each sketch.

**Mobile Design:**
![Final Home Page Mobile](finalhomemobile.JPG)
In the final mobile design, the users are first introduced to both the mission statement and the hero image, which gives a feeling of professional introduction, which is the feeling the client is looking for. The image fully expands across the mobile layout, fully grabbing the users' attention. Then, the content is placed intuitively. First, they are given brief context as to what the club is about. Then, through carousel interactivity, the users can learn more about the club's current project, which is followed by the opportunities they are given if they become part of the club. Thus, the layout is not only professional and pleasing to look at with how simple it is, but it also allows the users to efficiently scroll through the content.

![Resources Final Sketch](resources-final-mobile.png)
This sketch reorders the page so that the project and terms are stacked on top of each other, instead of side-by-side to account for the lost screen space on a mobile device. This still displays the information in a sensical way for users when they go on the site, because if a user is a member, they don't have to scroll through resources that are not applicable to them, but a potential member can see all of the resources available to them immediately.

![Meet the Team Final Sketch](team-final-mobile.png)
This sketch is a more defined version of iteration 2. This version allows for less scrolling, as a lot of information can be contained on one page without crowding. It also helps guide the user's eye, where they can glance left to right to find the member they are looking for. The interactivity helps limit crowding.

![How to Apply Final Mobile](apply-mobile.jpg)
This sketch adapts the mobile design to the narrow page width. It stacks the "Application Process" and "Tips" sections so that the page isn't crowded and the pages are smushed together. This allows users to easily follow the content of the page vertically from the top to the bottom.


**Desktop Design:**
![Final Home Page Desktop](finalhome.JPG)
Similar to the mobile design, the desktop design also initially welcomes the users with large yet pleasing hero image and mission statement to grab the users' attention. Then, the users can learn more about the club through the "About" page, while having the opportunity to interact with the carousel to learn more about current projects. This layout is kept aware of the users' natural reading pattern from left to right. Furthermore, the users can read more about the opportunities the club provides, which has been divided into three separate boxes in order to maintain visibility of the content as well as the simplicity of the overall layout.

![Resources Final Sketch](resources-final-desktop.png)
This sketch has a past project provided on the left side of the page and the terms on the right side. The "Members Only" link is at the top of the page, so that members can access it immediately. This design builds off the first two iterations and offers a more symmetric and spacious layout, which allows users to see the most relevant information immediately and in a simplistic way.

![Meet the Team Final Desktop](team-final-desktop.png)
This sketch is a more defined version of iteration 2. This version allows for less scrolling, as a lot of information can be contained on one page without crowding. It also helps guide the user's eye, where they can glance left to right to find the member they are looking for. The interactivity helps to give a professional look to the site, allowing the audience to easily access the contact information without having to look around too much.

![How to Apply Final Desktop](apply-desktop.jpg)
This sketch makes use of the increased page width. It expands the vertical organization of the content to a more horizantal orientation by unstacking the "Application Process" and "Tips" sections.

### Design Rationale (Milestone 2)
> Explain why your design is appropriate for your audience. Specially, why does your content organization, navigation, and site design/layout meet the goals of your users? How did you employ design patterns to improve the familiarity of the site for your audience?

Through user interviews we were able to group together our audience's goals into several categories. These categories are as follows: know leaders of club and how to reach out to current members, easily access all application information, learn more about the club, and  access resources related to real estate concepts. We organized the content of our site around these goals we identified for our users. Each page accomplishes one of our audience's goals. The "Meet Our Team" page allows site users to know leaders of club and how to reach out to current members, the "How to Apply" page allows site users to easily access all application information, the "Homepage" allows site users to learn more about the club, and the "Resources" page allows users to access resources related to real estate concepts. Our site's navigation compliments these pages by indicating what goal each page accomplishes. Additionally the individual pages are set up so that they can be easily navigated by using familiar desing patterns. Each page has content that progresses from the top left of the page to the bottom right. Additionally the pages are minimilalistic, not overly cluttered. The site also makes uses of familiar interactive design patterns such as a carousel.



## Interactivity Plan (Milestone 2)
> Now that you've designed your interactivity for your site, you need to plan how you will implement it.
> Describe how you will implement the interactivity. This should be a complete plan that another 1300 student could use to implement the interactivity.
> You should list the elements, any CSS classes, events, pseudocode, and the initial state.

CSS Interactivity Plan
- .`hidden` - hiden the modal box
- `button:hover` - changes background color of button when mouse hovers over
- `.close-button, .modal-button` - styled cleanly for professional look
- `.modal-content` - styled to be centered in page  covering around 30% of screen with background still showing

JavaScript Psudocode

```
repeat for each id difference:
    when #modal-button is clicken on
        remove .hidden class from #modal-content

    when #close-button is clicked on
        add class .hidden to #modal-content
```

Powerpoint Responsive Resize Plan

**This would be considered responsive design rather than interactivity, but Professor Harms said to plan first and then code, so I included pseudocode and planning below. The embed element's height and width must be set in HTML, which Professor Harms said was valid, but in order to make it responsive to the screen width, I had to use JavaScript to resize the element**

HTML planning
```
<embed id="nme" type="application/pdf" src="images/nme-presentation.pdf" width="430" height="350">

```
No CSS is used related to responsiveness of the embed element

```
upon opening, if the window width is less than 500px or between 800px and 950px
  set the #nme width to 300px
otherwise if the window width is between 600px and 800px
  set the #nme width to 500px

if the window is resized
  if the window width is less than 500px or between 800px and 950px
    set the #nme width to 300px
  otherwise if the window width is between 600px and 800px
    set the #nme width to 500px
  otherwise
    set the #nme width to 430px
```


## Client Feedback & Minutes (Milestone 2)
> You should meet with your client again to obtain feedback on your design.
> Provide a summary of the client's feedback and your meeting's minutes.

The client thought that the site made sense on an intuitive level and was impressed by the insight gained after the user interview process. The client likes the way that the content is organized, and does not suggest changing anything from our layout. He is also going to prepare a terms sheet and give us the needed content.

Zach: explain user centered design process and how we interviewed different people
Lucy: explain different content groupings and justify with user interviews
Lucy: show him the sketches and explain the interactivity
Lucy: ask if he has any feedback/field questions he may have
ask for timeline content, past project, current project, terms sheet, photos of members, contact info for members, application tips, any filler photos they might have

- Likes user interview results, says v helpful for them
- Makes sense for home page
- Likes pop out for members. Wants leaders emphasized
- Happy to give old projects
- Really like idea of terms sheet and sample project
- Wants to ask group members for opinions but rlly likes it
- Doesn’t know what else could be added. Thinks content groups make sense

    - The user did a great job completing the task without any confusion. Yes, the user met my expectation as I expected the user to complete the task without much trouble.
- **User’s reaction / feedback to the design** (e.g., specific problems or issues found in the tasks)
    - he user was initially impressed by the overall look and feel of the website. The user particularly enjoyed the introduction to the website with the hero image in the home page. The overall atmosphere of the website was professional and minimal with good overall structure.The user notes how intuitive the title of the page was on the navigation bar. Upon quickly glancing the navigation bar, the user notes, he was able to determine which page to exactly look for. The user also notes the hierarchy of information, whether it is shown through sizes of texts and etc., helped distinguish and identify the information easily.
- **Your reflections about the user’s performance to the task**
    - I was thoroughly impressed with not only how I quickly the user was able to complete the task but also with how much confidence the user navigated the website. During the testing, I didn't see any second guesses or confusion from the user.
- **Re-design choices**
    - I don't think any re-design is necessary. From the tester's point of view as well as that of the user, there weren't any confusion and/or misunderstanding while the user navigated the website to complete the task. In addition, since the user completed the task with precision and great efficiency, re-design choices don't seem necessary.

## Changes Based on User Testing (Final Submission)
> What changes did you make to your design based on user testing?

We did not make any changes to the design based on user testing.


## Final Notes to the Graders (Final Submission)
> 1. Give us three specific strengths of your site that sets it apart from the previous website of the client (if applicable) and/or from other websites. Think of this as your chance to argue for the things you did really well.

Our client began with a rough draft of a site in which they were using a website building application to create, however there was little information included with little content on the home page, and only an outline of other pages. Furthermore, because we used the user-centered design process, our site has more intuitive content grouping and caters to the true needs of prospective users. Informative and well-designed, our site is easy to navigate and has all of the relevant information provided on each page. Our site does not just serve as a display of the club's achievements, as many of the sites of similar clubs do; rather, it also helps guide prospective members navigate through the application process and become thoroughly informed before the application rounds.

> 2. Tell us what you, as a team, learned while working on this project.

As a team we learned the importance of communication and proper scheduling. Although it took some time to figure out what we needed to work on, we quickly understood that we learned better from eachother and completed our tasks far more effeciently when we communicated a lot, even on minute issues. A constant stream of communication and updates allowed us to not waste any time and easily help teamates with their work when needed. All members were easily accessible through texts and the occaisonal in person or zoom meeting, which made working together and planning together very swift and efficient. Also, as a team we learned to be very adaptive. Someone may have been assigned to do a task that was more work than we origionally thought, so we communicated our timings to make sure they got the extra help they needed from other team memebers so that no one was put in an unfair position. All around, the communication and honesty on timings and strengths helped make our group work really well together and create a project we are all very proud of.

> 3. Tell us anything else you need us to know for when we're looking at the project.

The one thing we, as a group want the grader to be aware of is the lack of content provided by the client. We appreciate all the work the client has been putting into the website by giving us content, however they requested a lot of content that they did not end up providing by this deadline at the moment. A lot of the content they either do not have yet themselves, or have yet to send after requested, therefore some of the content is not as bountiful that we would like or some things (such as the carousel) have to be filled with filler content (the images) rather than the content the cleint wants but has not provided (the example projects in the carousel). Additionally, the resources page was intended to include content related to supporting the users, but the client did not send over the "common terms sheet," which they promised to do several times. We tried our best to communicate with the client throughout the process, and kindly yet firmly reminded them a multitude of times that we needed the content, but unfortunately the client did not uphold their responsibilities.
